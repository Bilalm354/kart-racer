## Idea

Building a racing game in javascript with ThreeJS.

Using webpack to allow importing modules using ES6 imports and to allow bunding and modularisation of code.

## Planning

See the TODO.md file

## Dev

Start a local server with
`npm run start`

Produce a production build by running
`npm run build`
